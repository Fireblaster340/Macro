# Macro
This is a simple macro program. It can record your mouse presses, keypresses, mouse location and scroll speed. 
Once recorded, it stores it in a file which typically is under 1MB size, but it depends on how long your macro is. 
Once saved, you can replay the recording back and loop it, automating many things from boring data inputting, to AFK farming in games and even to spam people (if they consent to it ofc). There are some limitations, they are listed in the note in my program. You can also edit settings to make it more convinient. The files of recordings get stored in the folder "RecordedMacros" and their path gets added to file "PathNames", the program will catch inconsistencies between both and if there is one, you must manually add or remove a path name from the file PathNames. If you'd like to speed up the macro you could go into its recording file and make the first line a smaller number. I will add the ability to do this from the program.
