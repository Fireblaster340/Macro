# Macro
This is a simple macro program. It can record your mouse presses, keypresses, mouse location and scroll speed. 
Once saved, you can replay the recording back and loop it, automating many things from boring data inputting, to AFK farming in games and even to spam people (if they consent to it ofc). There are some limitations, they are listed in the note in my program. You can also edit settings to make it more convinient. The files of recordings get stored in the folder "RecordedMacros" and their path gets added to file "PathNames". There still are some errors that idk how to fix :)
# How to run
To use it, you need to download the files and put them in a folder together. Ideally you'd want to download the Macro folder as a whole. You can then delete the placeholder from the RecordedMacros folder. You can just pull the repo tbh. Now, run the MacroScript.py file in an IDE (if you are on windows, its inbuilt, just go to top and run the code). From here, you're all set to use it!
Once recorded, it stores it in a file which typically is under 1MB size, but it depends on how long your macro is.
